## FPM DRAM Controller (VHDL)

**Features:**

Right now it's pretty barebones and is WIP. Check back in a while for updates. It's meant to support auto closing and opening pages and should support multible banks with interleaving.

**Requirements:**

* VHDL simulator (currently tested with GHDL)
* GNU Make

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asimonf/dram-controller.git
   ```

2. Run the following to run a testbench:

   ```bash
   make TESTBENCH=testbench
   ```
3. Modify and customize the code based on your specific requirements.

**Folder Structure:**

* `src/`: Contains the source code and `src/top_level.vhd` contains the top level design
* `testbench/`: Contains testbenches for simulating the controller
* `lib/`: Defines constants and types used throughout the project
* `docs/`: Contains documentation

**Configuration:**

* Default memory parameters can be adjusted in `lib/constants.vhd` (if used)
* Refresh cycle timing can be modified in the controller code

**Further Considerations:**

* This is a basic implementation and may require extension for more advanced features.
