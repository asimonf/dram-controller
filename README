## FPM DRAM Controller (VHDL)

**Features:**

Right now it's pretty barebones and is WIP. Check back in a while for updates. It's meant to support auto closing and opening pages and should support multiple banks with interleaving support.

**Requirements:**

* VHDL simulator (currently tested with NVC)
* Python

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asimonf/dram-controller.git
   ```

2. Run the following to run a testbench:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
3. Modify and customize the code based on your specific requirements.

**Further Considerations:**

* This is a basic implementation and may require extension for more advanced features.
